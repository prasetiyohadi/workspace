# Vcluster

[vcluster](https://www.vcluster.com/) is a tool to create fully functional virtual Kubernetes clusters. Each vcluster runs inside a namespace of the underlying k8s cluster. It's cheaper than creating separate full-blown clusters and it offers better multi-tenancy and isolation than regular namespaces.
