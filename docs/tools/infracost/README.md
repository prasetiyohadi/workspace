# Infracost

[Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/) shows cloud cost estimates for Terraform. It lets DevOps, SRE and engineers see a cost breakdown and understand costs before making changes, either in the terminal or pull requests. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss costs as part of the workflow.
