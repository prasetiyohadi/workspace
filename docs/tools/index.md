## [UNIX rules for life](https://web.archive.org/web/20210614145725/https://stormrider.io/rules/)

- **Keep it simple**: It's cheaper and easier to carry around.
- **Do one thing at a time**: Multitasking is a lie.
- **Network**: You were born to connect.
- **Say what you mean**; nothing is truer than the truth.
- **Hack**: Trial and error is the only way we learn anything
- **Be who you are**: Even a bent wire can carry a great light.
- **Use leverage**; a bigger hammer isn't always the answer.
- **Use what you have**: never dig diamonds with a brick of gold.
- **Have faith**; all's possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.
- **Think ahead, but don't worship your plans**; remember today is the first
  day of the rest of your learning experience.
