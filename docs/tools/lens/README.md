[Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) - The Kubernetes IDE ("Lens IDE") is a distribution of the OpenLens repository with Team Lens specific customizations released under a traditional [EULA](https://k8slens.dev/licenses/eula). Lens IDE provides the full situational awareness for everything that runs in Kubernetes. It's lowering the barrier of entry for people just getting started and radically improving productivity for people with more experience.
