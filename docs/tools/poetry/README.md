# Poetry: Dependency Management for Python

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) helps you declare, manage and install dependencies of Python projects, ensuring you have the right stack everywhere.

[Github repository](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)

## Getting Started

Configure poetry to create virtual environments inside the project's root
directory.

```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
