[Memcached](http://memcached.org/) is free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering. In this documentation I will show how to install **memcached** using yum package manager with [Atomicorp](https://www.atomicorp.com/) repository.
