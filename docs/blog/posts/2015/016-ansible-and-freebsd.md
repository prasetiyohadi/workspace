By default, FreeBSD doesn't install a python package in its standard distribution. So, we need to install python, either manually or using **ansible** module.

    ansible freebsd-host -m raw -a 'env ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES=YES pkg install python' -u root

Of course before we can use **ansible** we have to install public key authentication and enable SSH to root user in FreeBSD host from controller machine. FreeBSD install python in different path than Linux machine, so we must set variable for the python interpreter, either in host file or variable files.

    ansible_python_interpreter: "/usr/local/bin/python"

Then test installed python interpreter.

    $ ansible freebsd-host -m ping -u root
    <ip address> | success >> {
     "changed": false,
     "ping": "pong"
    }

For new installation of FreeBSD, we should update port distribution using **portsnap**.
The ad-hoc command

    ansible freebsd-host -m command -a "/usr/sbin/portsnap fetch extract"

The playbook

    ---
    - hosts: freebsd-host
      remote_user: root
      vars:
        ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/local/bin/python
      tasks:
      - name: update portsnap
        command: /usr/sbin/portsnap fetch extract

After that we are ready to begin using **ansible** to automate our servers.
