[Beanstalkd](https://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/) is a simple, fast work queue. Its interface is generic, but was originally designed for reducing the latency of page views in high-volume web applications by running time-consuming tasks asynchronously. In this documentation, I will show how to install **Beanstalkd** on CentOS 6.

---

Install **Beanstalkd** from **EPEL** repository using **yum**

    sudo rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
    sudo yum install beanstalkd

Enable and start **Beanstalkd** service

    sudo chkconfig beanstalkd on
    sudo service beanstalkd start
