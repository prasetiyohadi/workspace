[Redis](http://redis.io/) is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value cache and store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and hyperloglogs. In this documentation, I will show how to install **Redis** on CentOS 6.

---

Install **Development Tools**

    sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

Download and extract latest Redis package from <http://redis.io/>
wget <http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-2.8.19.tar.gz>
tar zxf redis-2.8.19.tar.gz
Go to redis directory and run make

    cd redis-2.8.19
    make

it is a good idea to run make test

    sudo yum install tcl
    make test

Then run make install

    sudo make install

Add `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/sbin` to your **secure_path** in `/etc/sudoers`

Install as service

    sudo ./utils/install-server.sh
