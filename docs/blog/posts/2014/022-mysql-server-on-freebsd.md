### Installation using FreeBSD ports

Login as root, then to make sure our server's hostname can be identified locally we need to edit /etc/hosts.

    # ee /etc/hosts
    ::1               localhost localhost.example.com
    127.0.0.1         localhost localhost.example.com
    192.168.1.11      host.example.com

Install MySQL Server with following command.

    # cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql56-server
    # make -D BUILD_OPTIMIZED install clean
    # rehash

After installation finished, run script for installing main database and tables used by MySQL.

    # mysql_install_db --user=mysql –basedir=/usr/local/

Run following command to start MySQL daemon and create password for MySQL's root. # mysqld_safe & # mysqladmin -u root password 'localpassword' # mysqladmin -u root -h host.example.com password 'remotepassword'

MySQL has three types of configuration files i.e. _my-small.cnf, my-medium.cnf, my-large.cnf,_ and _my-huge.cnf_. Copy suitable configuration file to _/var/db/mysql_.

    # cp /usr/local/share/mysql/my-medium.cnf /var/db/mysql/my.cnf

To deactivate MySQL TCP Networking edit MySQL configuration file.

    # ee /var/db/mysql/my.cnf
    skip-networking

Save and exit text editor.

### Test MySQL Server Installation

In order MySQL to start at boot time, edit file _/etc/rc.conf_

    # ee /etc/rc.conf
    mysql_enable="YES"

Restart MySQL to apply change in configuration file.

    # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql-server restart

For checking if MySQL is running correctly, run following command.

    # mysqlshow –p

If MySQL running then the following output will appear.

    +---------------------------+
    |         Databases         |
    +---------------------------+
    | information_schema        |
    | mysql                     |
    | test                      |
    +---------------------------+

If there is error then the error log is saved in file _/var/db/mysql/host.example.com.err_. Check the permission of _/tmp_ directory.

    # ls -ld /tmp
    drwxrwxrwt    7 root  wheel      512 Feb 17 12:00 /tmp

If the output is not the same with line above, repair it with following command.

    # chown root:wheel /tmp
    # chmod 777 /tmp
    # chmod =t /tmp

Installation of MySQL Server is finished.
