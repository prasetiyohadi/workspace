**DRBD** refers to block devices designed as a building block to form high availability cluster. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via an assigned network. DRBD can be understood as network based RAID-1. ([DRBD](http://www.drbd.org/))

Sometimes we have a disk failure on hard drive which contains DRBD backing device. The following steps can be used to replace or recover the failed drive.

#### 1. detach drbd resource from broken backing storage

    # drbdadm detach <resource>

#### 2. check state of drbd disk

    # drbdadm dstate <resource>
    Diskless/UpToDate

#### 3. if using internal meta data, bind DRBD device to new hard disk

    # drbdadm create-md <resource>
    # drbdadm attach <resource>

#### 4. if using external meta data DRBD unable to recognize hard drive was swapped, need additional step

    # drbdadm create-md <resource>
    # drbdadm attach <resource>
    # drbdadm invalidate <resource>
